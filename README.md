# Inches-to-Cm-to-Inches Converter
I made this when I first learned javascript.


A super-simple Google search will only yield a single cm-to-in (or 1 in-to-cm) converter.
 
This one can do 10 cm-to-in (or 10 in-to-cm) converters at the same time.

Why would you need that? https://itsvictoroyedeji.github.io/in-cm-converter/
